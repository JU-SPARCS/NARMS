User
  The usual stuff for a user. Email, password etc.
  A user is linked to
    - a uniq Role
    - several WorkerProfile (optional)
    - several ThirdParty::Provider::User (optional)
        For example, it can be linked to a SAFAPS user token to
        perform queries

Role
  This model exists to abstract from the code all the permission
  verification. Instead of having, for example, a 'switch' for each
  role containing 'if' statements, we end with only a few 'if'.
  It is also easier to maintain :
    Want to create a new role?
      Instead of recoding everything for this role,
      just create a new record in base!
    Want to change permissions for a role?
      Instead of modifying throw the entire code the permission,
      just change it live using the record!
  A role is linked to
    - several User
    - an AuditsPermissionsTable
    - an ATCOAdministrationPermissionsTable
    - a ShiftManagementPermissionsTable
    - a ComplianceBreachPermissionsTable
    - a LoggingAndComplianceCheckingPermissionsTable

*PermissionsTable
  It is a container to regroup every permissions related to the
  same domain. Its purpose is only to clarify the use of permissions.
  A *PermissionsTable is linked to
    - a Role

WorkerProfile
  This model is the direct representation of someone who has to use
  his identification card/device when working in a facility.
  A user can have several WorkerProfile since an ATCO, for example,
  can move from a facility to another.
  A WorkerProfile is linked to
    - a User
    - a Facility
    - several Shift
    - several LogEvent
    - several WorkerSchedule

Shift
  This model is for the moment a way to represent a group of
  WorkerProfile as favorites/easy-picked-profiles for a shift manager.
  In case shifts should be evaluated as groups of workers for a
  period of time, the transformation of this model will consist only
  in the creating of two new DateTime fields 'start' and 'end'.
  A Shift is linked to
    - several WorkerProfile
    - a Facility

Facility
  It represents the physical facility and is used to keep every
  entity based on this place linked.
  A Facility is linked to
    - several WorkerProfile
    - several Shift
    - several Workstation
    - several ThirdParty::Provider::Organization
    - a ThirdParty::Recipient::User

Workstation
  It represents the physical workstation. This model exists because
  it lightweights the LogEvent records (we don't need to save for each
  of those recods the name of the workstation) and allow us to keep
  trace of its use throw a WorkstationSchedule model.
  A Workstation is linked to
    - several LogEvent
    - several WorkstationSchedule
    - a Facility
