The file 'NARMS populate.txt' contains code that you can use to populate the database with some data. 
IT is NOT necessary to use it. You can write code that will populate the database yourself. 

If you want to use it just cd into the Padrino project folder. Type 'padrino console', a shell will open.
Then you just copy and paste the contents of 'NARMS populate.txt'.
